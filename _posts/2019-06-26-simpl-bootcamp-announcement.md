    Sign-up for the first-ever Simpl Bootcamp on November 1, 2019!
---

Last year we were happy to announce the release of Simpl to the Open Source community.  Since then, the Learning Lab has worked on another Simpl simulation with hopes of releasing it in the classroom this upcoming Fall semester.  I’m happy to report that the platform continues to meet our needs, even when using a model with hundreds of data points (the simulation under development is significantly more complex than our first Simpl simulation).  Though time has passed since our release, we’re still passionate about sharing Simpl with the world.

To that end, the [Alfred West Jr. Learning Lab](http://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu) and [Wharton Interactive](https://interactive.wharton.upenn.edu/) is pleased to announce our first-ever Simpl Bootcamp!  It will take place online and on the campus of The Wharton School on Friday, November 1, 2019.  This 1-day bootcamp is aimed at both developers and practitioners to show what Simpl can do and get you on the path of developing your own Simpl simulations.  During this bootcamp you’ll hear from the core authors of the platform as we start with the design principles that govern the data model, to developing a game idea, to writing your first lines of code to bring that idea to life.  Below is a tentative agenda for our 1-day bootcamp:

* Introduction to Simpl
* The Data Model
* Developer Training/Instructional Design
* Hands-On Coding with Simpl

When we first built Simpl we had two distinct audiences in mind.  One was the developers who will use the platform to bring Simpl games to life.  The other were the practitioners who are professors, instructional designers, or more broadly, anyone involved in teaching that believes that a game or simulation can improve the learning experience for their students.  Though Simpl requires development resources to use, both sets of users are critical to the success of your game or simulation in the classroom.  That being said, this bootcamp is aimed at both practitioners and developers to get acclimated with Simpl and both audiences will come away with tools to bring a Simpl simulation to life. 

If you are interested in attending either online or in-person please fill out the form below.  More information will be coming soon on this exciting event!
